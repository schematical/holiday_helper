The buffer is used as the source used to create output.\n\n# Features\n - Precision extraction of functions or variables from the input buffer\n  - Rename functions or variables as they are extracted\n  - Control the depth at which variables and function are searched for\n  - Extract any arbitrary value\n - Read multiple files and piped data to the input buffer\n - Concatenate files and piped data\n - Automatically wrap the output in a closure that can detect the javascript environment\n - Hint and or Lint the output\n - Reads your `package.json` to create versioned output filenames and up to date build comments\n - Chainable and asynchronous APIs\n\n# Installation\n\n```bash\n$npm install codesurgeon\n```\n\n# Status\n\n<img src=\"https://secure.travis-ci.org/hij1nx/codesurgeon.png\" alt=\"build status\">\n\n# Usage\nWrite a javascript file and run it.\n\n```bash\n$node mybuildscript.js\n```\n\nCodesurgeon will appreciate piped input!\n\n```bash\n$cat myfile1.js myfile2.js | node mybuildfile.js\n```\n\n## Synchronous example\nAll writes are done synchronously by default (can be done asynchronously), so you can chain them. Here are a few examples. Here is a Build script examples using the above source file\n\n```js\nvar Codesurgeon = require('codesurgeon').Codesurgeon;\nvar surgeon = new Codesurgeon;    // make an instance\n\nsurgeon\n  .configure({                    // lets add some configuration options!\n    quiet: true,                  // don't output the status of each task\n    package: '../package.json'    // read my package.json and use it for version numbers etc.\n  })\n  .read('/*.js')                  // add one or more files to add to the buffer\n  .extract(                       // specify the names in the order we want them to be compiled\n    'B',\n    'a'\n  )\n  .write(__dirname + '/dest.js'); // write the buffer to a file\n```\n\n## Asynchronous example\nRead and write methods can be used asynchronously by adding a callback!\n\n```js\n  surgeon\n    .configure({\n      quiet: true,\n      package: '../package.json'\n    })\n    .read(\n      '/*.js',\n      function() { // callback to fire after reading...\n\n        //\n        // calling `extract` without parameters would extract everything from the buffer.\n        //\n        this.extract(\n          'B', \n          'a'\n        );\n\n        this.write(__dirname + '/dest.js');\n\n      }\n    );\n```\n\n### Source file\n\n```js\nfunction A() { return 'A'; }\nfunction B() { return 'B'; }\nvar a = 100 + 100;\nvar b = 100 + 100;\nfunction C() { return 'C'; }\n```\n\n### Destination File \nUses the specified `package.json` to add a header and change the filename to include the version number.\n\n```js\n//\n// Generated on Thu Sep 29 2012 12:29:42 GMT-0400 (EDT) by Codesurgeon.\n// Version 0.1.6\n//\n\nfunction B() { return 'B'; }\nvar a = 100 + 100;\n```\n\n## Extract-Code-As\nIt is easy to change the name of an item that is extracted!\n\n```js\nsurgeon\n  .read(\n    '/dummy1.js', \n    '/dummy2.js'\n  )\n  .extract(\n    'A',\n    ['C', 'D'] // rename the item (works with dot notation too)\n  );\n```\n\n### Destination File\n\n```js\n//\n// Generated on Thu Sep 29 2011 12:29:42 GMT-0400 (EDT) by Codesurgeon.\n// Version 0.1.6\n//\nfunction A() { return 'A'; }\nfunction D() { return 'C'; } // this has been renamed\n```\n\n## Automatic Wrapping\nWhen compiling a script that will be used in multiple environments, you often want to wrap the code in a closure that will detect the correct environment and pass it in.\n\n### Source file\n\n```js\nfunction A() { ... }\n```\n\n### Destination file\nContains a closure that is passed the object relevant to the environment. See the API reference below to change the arguments or detection expression.\n\n```js\n(function(exports) {\n  function A() { ... }\n}(typeof process !== \"undefined\" && process.title ? module : window));\n\n```\n\n# API\n\n## Constructor\nThe constructor function provides an instance of the Codesurgen.\n\n### Codesurgeon(conf)\n```\n  function Codesurgeon(conf)\n  \n  @param conf {Object} a json object literal that can contain configuration options.\n    @member encoding {String} the encoding that will be used to product the result.\n    @member quiet {String} indicate how much logging you want Codesurgen to produce.\n    @member noVersion {Boolean} true if you don't want Codesurgeon to automatically version your output filename.\n```\n\n## Instance Methods\n\n### configure(conf)\nAllows you to pass configuration settings to the instance, helpful as you chain together methods.\n\n```\n  function configure(conf)\n  \n  @param conf {Object} a json object literal that can contain configuration options.\n```\n\n### package(path)\nCapture package details of a `package.json` file. Used in concert with the `write` method. The write method will attempt to read the file and \n\n```\n  function package(path)\n  \n  @param path {String} a path to a valid `package.json` file.\n```\n\n### read(...files)\nRead one or more files from disk. Accepts wild cards in the filename, eg. `*-foo.js`.\n\n```\n  function read(file [, file, ...])\n  \n  @param file {String} a string that represent the locations of a file.\n```\n\n### clear(buffer)\nProvides the means to clear the input and or output buffers before the next read and write.\n\n```\n  function clear(buffer)\n  \n  @param buffer {String} The buffer to be cleared, `input`, `output` or `both`.\n```\n\n### wrap(options)\nWraps the code in a closure.\n\n```\n  function wrap(conf)\n  \n  @param conf {Object} a json object literal that can contain configuration options.\n  \n  @param outer {String} code that will be appended outside of the closure.\n  \n  @param before {String} a string of code to prepend to the body of the closure.\n  \n  @param after {String} a string of code to append to the body of the closure.\n  \n  @param params {String} the parameters that you want to pass to the closure\n  \n  @param signature {String} the method signature (parameters that go inside the closure's \n  parenthesis e.g. `function(foo, bar, bazz)` where \"foo, bar, bazz\" is the signature).\n```\n\n### extract(...name) // WITHOUT PARAMETERS WILL EXTRACT EVERYTHING\nSpecifies the names of the items that you would like to extract from the input buffer. You can specify a simple variable or function name such as `myMethod` or you can be specific about the item you are looking for, e.g. `MyConstructor.prototype.foo`. This is helpful in the case where you have another method named `foo` that might occur beforehand, e.g. `OtherConstructor.prototype.foo`.\n\n```\n  function extract(name [, name, ...])\n  \n  @param name {String} a series of strings that represent the items that can be found in the code that has been read by the `read` method.\n```\n\n### exclude(...name) // WITHOUT PARAMETERS WILL EXCLUDE EVERYTHING\nSpecifies the names of the items that you would like to exclude from whatever was extracted.\n\n```\n  function exclude(name [, name, ...])\n  \n  @param name {String} a series of strings that represent the items that can be found in the code that has been extracted by the `extract` method.\n```\n\n### write(file)\nWrite the output to a file.\n\n```\n  function write(file)\n  \n  @param file {String} a file name that will be created or overwritten.\n```\n\n### append(file)\nWrite the output to a file.\n\n```\n  function append(file)\n  \n  @file {String} a file name that will be appended to.\n```\n\n### uglify(conf)\nCompacts and/or obfuscates the code.\n\n```\n  function uglify(conf)\n  \n  @param conf {Object} a json object literal that can contain configuration options.\n  \n    @member squeeze {String} Applies various compression techniques. It expects an AST \n    (as returned by parse-js) and returns a new, compatible AST (possibly sharing \n    structure with the original one!).\n    \n    @member mangle {String} This option is careful not to affect the semantics of the code. \n    It will avoid renaming undeclared variables (which could possibly be defined in some \n    other script), and avoid renaming names that are under the influence of a with block, \n    or within the context of an eval call.\n```\n\n### lint(conf)\nProvides strict javascript validation according to Duglass Crockford's JSLint specification (https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSLint)\n\n```\n  function lint(success [, fail, options])\n  \n  @param success {Function} a callback that will be executed if the code passed the requirements \n  of the lint parser.\n\n  @param fail {Function} optional, a callback that will be executed if the code failed the \n  requirements of the lint parser.\n\n  @param options {Object} optional, an object literal containing the options that are supported \n  by the parser.\n```\n\nMost of the options are booleans: They are all optional and have a default value of false. One of the options, predef, can be an array of names, which will be used to declare global variables, or an object whose keys are used as global names, with a boolean value that determines if they are assignable. If the code is not valid, you will see a print out of the issues that were found. The format of the errors will be printed in the form of an array of objects containing these members:\n\n```js\n{\n    line      : The line (relative to 0) at which the lint was found\n    character : The character (relative to 0) at which the lint was found\n    reason    : The problem\n    evidence  : The text line in which the problem occurred\n    raw       : The raw message before the details were inserted\n    a         : The first detail\n    b         : The second detail\n    c         : The third detail\n    d         : The fourth detail\n}\n```\n\n### hint()\nLess Strict javascript validation according to JSHint, a community-driven tool to detect errors in JavaScript code. (https://github.com/jshint)\n\n```\n  function hint(success [, fail, options])\n  @param success {Function} a callback that will be executed if the code passed the requirements \n  of the lint parser.\n  \n  @param fail {Function} optional, a callback that will be executed if the code failed the \n  requirements of the lint parser.\n  \n  @param options {Object} optional, an object literal containing the options that are supported \n  by the parser.\n```\n\n# License\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2010 hij1nx <http://www.twitter.com/hij1nx>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
